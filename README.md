Monk Customer Services Database for Gaming Industry using HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP and PSQL

This project was part of my Databases class, where my partner and I designed a customer services database for a hardware gaming company. We had to seperately build our own database and front end. All code in this repository is from me. 

PHP files contain Javascript for website as well. Most code would be in console.php, front.php. report.php. Website is: http://delphi.cs.csubak.edu/~apoon/ signin with sn:agent1@oxysquare.com pw: test123

Our technical report attached in this file shows our design. Phases 1, 2, and 3 were done in partners. Phase 4 and 5 were done 
individually.
